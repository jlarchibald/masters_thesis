\section{Spectrum Analyzer}

The spectrum analyzer consists of a 10 cm cavity with two mirrors XXXXXXX FIND OUT WHICH ONES. 

The cavity is designed to be very nearly semiconfocal. This is to abet the cavity's \footnote{How do I know whether I'm semiconfocal for all practical purposes? I mean, somehow lower finesse should make me less sensitive to small variations in the cavity length. Furthermore, are there models where the errors never really go away? You know? I guess I mean where it doesn't just become part of the noise. I suppose chaos is one example of this--where arbitrarily high precision is needed to predict even the macroscopic behavior of the system. Is any aspect of this system chaotic?}
