  \Abstract{
We discuss the construction of a 408 nm laser system for use in a $^{87}$Sr+ ion interferometer. This work reports progress towards driving stimulated Raman transitions between the $F=4$ and $F=5$ $^2$S$_{1/2}$ states of $^{87}$Sr$+$ using the $^2$P$_{3/2}$ state as the intermediate state.

The scope of this work is limited to the construction of a laser system that is intended to drive the stimulated Raman transitions in our ion interferometer experiment (also known as the 408 nm 5GHz detuned laser system).
This work also includes a discussion of the relevant theory along with some calculations about the transition rates and power levels involved in getting the experiment to work. 

We will also provide a brief summary of the ion interferometer and a discussion of its place among related experiments.

  \Acknowledgments{
I have benefitted enormously from the kindness and generosity of many people who went above and beyond what they were expected to do to support me in the writing of this thesis.

I am grateful to the entire BYU physics department and faculty. Even though I was not always a model student, I loved my time at BYU and I benefitted enormously from the people and facilities I encountered there. The staff and faculty at BYU always made me feel like the system was on my side, even when I did not deserve it. Many professors went the extra mile to help me out or give me advice. I never felt like an imposition or a burden, even when I was, and I frequently felt surprised at the level of personal attention and care that I received at the hands of my instructors. In particular, I would like to thank the three longstanding members of my committee--Drs. Bergeson, Van Huele and Durfee for their patience and for their embodiment of this ideal in my experiences with them in the classroom and as I have come to them for help with the various problems I encountered in my research and learning.

I am particularly indebted to my advisor, Dallin. The level of patience and support he has shown me have been orders of magnitude more than I ever could have hoped for or expected. He has been there for me during dark periods of my life. He is also a model teacher, scholar and friend. 

This thesis would not have happened without the help and support of my lovely (soon-to-be) wife, Camille, whose deeply-felt desire to see me succeed in finishing this thesis has moved me in a way that few things have. I would also like to thank my parents for their unyielding support and my old boss Kerry Glover.
