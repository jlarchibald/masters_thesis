% The caption package allows you to change the formatting of figure captions.
% The commands here change to the suggested caption format: single spaced and a bold tag

% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.

% The makeidx package makes your index for you.  To make an index entry,
% go to the place in the book that should be referenced and type
%  \index{key}
% An index entry labeled "key" (or whatever you type) will then
% be included and point to the correct page.

% If you have a lot of equations, you might be interested in the amstex package.
% It defines a number of environments and macros that are helpful for mathematics.
% We don't do much math in this example, so we haven't used amstex here.

% The hyperref package provides automatic linking and bookmarking for the table
% of contents, index, equation references, and figure references.  It must be
% included for the BYU Physics class to make a properly functioning electronic
% thesis.  It should be the last package loaded if possible.

% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your

% To add a bookmark in the pdf you can use \pdfbookmark.  You can look up its usage
% in the hyperref package documentation

% The text of your abstract
  \Abstract{We discuss the construction of a 408 nm laser system for use in a $^{87}$Sr+ ion interferometer. The laser system produces two coupled beams with a 5 GHz relative detuning that are designed to stimulate Raman transitions between the $F=4$ and $F=5$ $^2$S$_{1/2}$ states of $^{87}$Sr+ using the $^2$P$_{3/2}$ state as the intermediate state. We present a detailed explanation of the design and construction of the laser system and calculations of the transition rate between the two states.}
