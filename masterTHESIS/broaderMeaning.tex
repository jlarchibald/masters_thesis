\subsection{Experimental Verification of Classical Electromagnetic Theory}
The experiment traces its intellectual heritage to Cavendish's experiment to test Coulomb's law. 

This has been the basis for all of the laboratory experiments up through the 20th century. 

There are currently even more recent experiments.

%\section{how our machine will put limits on electromagnetic theory}

%Here I discuss the phase change of the atoms, etc. 

\section{The most recent, cutting-edge experimental E\&M measurements}

There are a few other lab experiments working on this. 

\section{Relationship to other ways of inferring Photon Rest mass}
