This work includes an overview of ion interferometer experiment and a detailed exposition of the construction of the laser system that drives the stimulated Raman transitions.

The ion interferometer uses a Mach-Zehnder setup to achieve interferometry with $^{87}$Sr+ ions.


\chapter{Antecedents}
\section{Historical Precedents}
In this chapter, we will discuss the taxonomy of related experiments in an effot to offer some context for our experiment. This will include historical intellectual forebears and some more modern cousins. 
 \subsection{Interferometry with light}
Matter interferometry borrows many of its foundational concepts and terminology from interferometric light experiments. Though the interference of light has been the subject of serious study for a long time (e.g. Newton's rings), Young's double slit experiment is perhaps the quintessential optics experiment. Recall that Young placed two slits and passed light through them. He then observed a pattern of alternating dark and light fringes corresponding to the regions of constructive and destructive interference. 

The diffraction of light in this way is in fact directly analogous to the methods use in some matter-wave interferometry experiments. For example, Alex Kronin uses very small gratings to produce similar patterns \footnote{find a citation}. 
DeBroglie hypothesized that matter exhibits wave-like behavior. Some of the earliest direct confirmation of this was achieved by Davisson and Germer, whose electron scattering experiment was directly analogous in interpretation to Bragg diffraction experiments performed using light. 
\subsection{Coherent Manipulation of Matter}
Matterwave interferometry arose with the development of techniques for the coherent control and measurement of atoms \footnote{I need to cite Kronin's RMP here, but I'll do it in a minute}. Rabi's use of rf resonance to control the internal states of atoms was a particularly big step forward. Ramsey's work in creating long-lived superpositions was similarly seminal \footnote{same citation}. 

More recently, atom interferometers have been used for many different types of experiments. These have provided high-precision measurements of the fine structure constant \footnote{I'll have to find some citations. This is basically just a list of things I saw at conferences that I thought were cool}, investigations of gravitational effects and placed ever tighter limits on potential deviations from Standard Model physics. 
%\subsection{Charged Particle Atomic Physics}

\subsection{Laboratory-based electromagnetic tests}
Our experiment is a direct descendant of an experiment performed by Cavendish\footnote{I am not refering to the famous torsion balance gravitational experiment.} Cavendish had a conducting enclosure and a method for measuring the presence of electric fields inside the enclosure. By demonstrating that the electric fields were 0 regarldless of the charge on the enclosure, Cavendish was able to deduce that the repulsion between like electric charges falls off in proportion to the inverse of the square of the distance between them. \footnote{todo: cite this guy later maybe:  http://geometrydude.wordpress.com/2012/12/22/cavendishs-phenomenological-derivation-of-coulombs-law/}. 

Our experiment is similar to Cavendish's experiment in two ways: First, our experiment seeks to . Cavendish was able to deduce the $1/r^2$ in Coulomb's law. performed electrical experiments that verified that charge on a conductor Cavendish's experiment directly tested electromagnetic theory by making was the first\footnote{who am I to say who did what first?}\cite{jackson} \footnote{it'd be nice to get Cavendish's original paper}  

In fact, Cavendish's experiment directly inspired our experiment\footnote{This is a piece of lab oral history that I wanted to preserve}. Brian Neyenhuis, whose time working in Dallin's lab overlapped with mine, came across a practice GRE question about the best laboratory measurements to date confirming Coulomb's law. It turned out that these were a variation on Cavendish's method. They key limiting factor in all cases was the experimenter's ability to measure small electric fields inside the conducting shell. Brian started investigating the use of atomic physics techniques to improve these measurements. Soon he and Dallin had fleshed out their idea for creating an ion interferometer.  

Our experiment can and may eventually become a very accurate laboratory test of classical electrodynamics.
Even though it is now more customary to talk in terms of limits to the photon rest mass than it is to refer to deviations from Coulomb's inverse square law, our experiment is nevertheless exactly analogous in both form and purpose

The best recent electromagnetic measurements will be discussed here. 

\subsection{More recent antecedent}
Electron interferometry using gratings has been achieved. \footnote{cite!!} Furthermore, ion interferometry has been achieved only using physical gratings. One of our experiment's main advantages is that its beamsplitters use no physical gratings

There are atomic clocks that use long-lived coherent superpositions of internal states of ions.\footnote{todo:cite}. However, The ions themselves do not enclose spacelike areas over the course of their path.

Coherent manipulation has also (thankfully!) been achieved in many labs \footnote{Todo:CITE!}. For example, neutral Sr has been trapped and cooled by XXXXX. 
Other experiments involving Sr TODO: add the other experiments.

The interest in $^{87}$Sr+ has been helpful not least because there are good numerical estimates of various transition parameters \cite{safronovaTheory}
