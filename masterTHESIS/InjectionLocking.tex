 \chapter{Injection Locking}
 (mode matching, measuring photocurrent from lasers, details of optimizing the isolators, some important caveats about not letting the wrong light couple back into the other laser. 

In order to achieve injection locking, we must couple the shifted light that originated at the Master laser into the laser cavities of each of the slave lasers.

For Slave 1, the half-intensity angle was rated to be 9$^\circ$ in the direction parallel to the polarization\footnote{note sure, just has symbols for parallel and perpendicular} and 19$^\circ$ in the perpendicular direction.
