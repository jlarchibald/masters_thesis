%the sum of the whole is greater than the parts 

The laser system consists of several components arranged together on a breadboard.

There are three separate laser diodes in housings. One of them is designated the ``Master'' laser. The other two are designated ``Slave 1'' and ``Slave 2.'' 

The actual light used in the experiment comes out of the two slaves. The master laser is supposed to serve as a stable frequency reference so that the slave lasers can be seeded by it. Thus, the basic objective is to make a stable master laser tuned near the mean of the frequencies that we desire out of the slave lasers. This will then be shifted by an AOM and injected into the slave lasers. We then "injection lock" them to see if 

The advantage of this setup is that if the master laser were to drift, both slaves would presumably drift with it. As we will later see, the experiment is less sensitive to common mode drift between the two slave lasers than it is to the drifting of individual slaves.


The master laser is grating stabilized using an extended cavity formed by a  %look this up
lines/mm diffraction grating mounted on a piezoelectric mount. 

The master laser passes through two optical isolators. It is then passed through a pair of waveplates and a polarizing beam cube, which serves the dual purpose of allowing us to attenuate the portion of the beam that goes through the AOM and splitting off a beam that can be used in our spectrum analyzer. 

After this, the laser is passed twice through an Acousto-optic Modulator (AOM). It first passes through in one direction before being retroreflected and sent in the other direction. This splits off two beams, one of which is shifted upwards by 2.5 GHz and the other of which is shifted downward by 2.5 GHz. These two beams are then coupled through optical isolators into the two slave lasers. The outputs of these two lasers are what we use in our experiment to achieve stimulated Raman transitions. 

Both slaves are also redirected to the spectrum analyzer.
