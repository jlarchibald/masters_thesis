\chapter{Laser System Overview}
%the sum of the whole is greater than the parts 

This chapter provides a broad introduction to the laser system addressed in this thesis. More information on the Master Laser configuration and setup can be found in Chapter \ref{generationOfSeedLight}. Information about the AOM configuration can be found in Chapter \ref{AOMInstallChapter}. The process of injection locking the slave lasers is discussed in more detail in Chapter \ref{InjectionLockingChapter}. Data from the working system can be found in Chapter \ref{triumphantDataChapter}.

The purpose of this system is to produce two lasers which are near resonant with the 5s $^2$S$_{1/2}$ to 5p$^2$P$_{3/2}$ transition in $^{87}$Sr$+$, but which differ in frequency by precisely 5 GHz, which corresponds to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state. This is necessary to drive the stimulated Raman transitions for our experiment. As we will later see, the experiment is less sensitive to common mode drift between the two slave lasers than it is to the drifting of individual slaves. It is, in general, difficult to stabilize a laser to a particular frequency. However, the difference in frequency between the slave lasers is set by an RF function generator with sub-Hz precision.

\section{Basic Design}
%As we will find in Chapter\,\ref{ChapterAboutTheAtoms}, our ability to drive the transitions depends strongly on the difference between the lasing frequencies of our two lasers. In contrast, we expect our experiment to be relatively less sensitive to common mode drifts in the frequencies of our lasers.
The laser system consists of several components arranged together on a 12''$\times$48'' breadboard that is mounted to an optical table. The breadboard is enclosed by a plastic case. The current driver circuits and temperature controllers for the lasers are mounted on a shelf above the laser enclosure along with the RF generator, RF amplifier along with various pieces of test and measurement equipment.

There are three separate laser diodes in housings. One of them is designated the ``Master'' laser. The other two are designated ``Slave 1'' and ``Slave 2.'' 
 A diagram of the main components of the system can be found in Figure\,\ref{diagramOfSetup3} while a picture of the completed setup can be found in Figure\,\ref{fullexperimentphoto}. 

The advantage of this setup is that if the master laser were to drift, both slaves would drift with it. The light that will actually be used on the atoms in the experiment comes out of the two slaves. The master laser serves as a stable frequency reference so that the slave lasers can be seeded by it. Thus, the basic objective is to make a stable master laser tuned near the mean of the frequencies that we desire out of the slave lasers. This will then be shifted by an AOM and coupled into the slave lasers. The slave lasers are adjusted so that they are able to amplify the light from the AOM and lase with the same frequency as the light that comes out at the AOM. This is what is meant by ``injection locking.''

	A cartoon diagram of the basic pieces of the apparatus. The master laser is depicted on the upper right. Its beam passes through two optical isolators in series. After this, the AOM is depicted with the upshifted and downshifted light coming out at exaggerated angles. These beams are then coupled into the rejection ports of two other optical isolators. Half waveplates are mounted in front of each of the slave lasers to rotate the polarization of the light to match the input polarizers on the isolators. The beams that will be used in the experiment are shown exiting through the lower right side of the diagram. The waveplates and polarizing beam cube that are used to adjust the light coupling into the AOM are not depicted.

\section{Following the beam path}
Light from the master laser passes through two optical isolators. These use Faraday rotation and a pair of glan polarizers to ensure that light travelling away from the master laser is allowed to propagate while light is prevented from coming back into the master laser. See Fig.~\ref{isolatorPicture}.

\begin{figure}

\caption[Optical Isolator Illustration]{\label{isolatorPicture} Optical isolators work via Faraday rotation of the light. The Faraday effect occurs in certain materials when placed under a strong magnetic field. The Faraday effect results in the rotation of the polarization of light as it passes through a crystal. The direction of the change in polarization is depicted in the diagram. The image on the left shows an isolator rejecting light, while the image on the right depicts the same isolator allowing light travelling in the opposite direction to pass through.}
\end{figure}

Optical isolators are important because the stability of the master laser and the injection locking of the slave lasers requires control of the light being coupled into the laser cavity. By installing isolators, we can prevent unwanted reflections back into the master laser. This is an especially serious issue for the master laser since later in the beam path, we retroreflect the beam in such a way that, absent the isolators, light would couple directly back into the master laser. 

The beam then passes through a pair of waveplates and a polarizing beam cube, which serves the dual purpose of allowing us to attenuate the portion of the beam that goes through the AOM and splitting off a beam that can be used in our spectrum analyzer. A discussion of the method we used for adjusting the quantity of light passing through these waveplates can be found in Appendix \ref{twoWaveplateTrick}.

After this, the laser is passed twice through an Acousto-optic Modulator (AOM). The first-order diffracted beam from the first pass through the AOM produces light that is shifted up in frequency (down in wavelength). However, most of the power is contained in the 0th order beam that passes through the AOM without being shifted at all. We collimate this beam and retroreflect it and send it in the other direction. This pass produces a weak beam that is downshifted in frequency. We thus end up with two beams, one of which is shifted upwards by 2.5 GHz and the other of which is shifted downward by 2.5 GHz. These two beams are then coupled through optical isolators into the two slave lasers. The outputs of these two lasers are what we use in our experiment to achieve stimulated Raman transitions. Part of the light from each of the slaves are also redirected to the spectrum analyzer.

%We could have maybe used light coming out the rejection ports to monitor second order effects from the AOM.

\section{Verifying that it worked}
We use a Fabry-Perot spectrum analyzer to monitor whether the slaves are injection locked and to verify that the master laser and slave lasers are running single mode. 
The spectrum analyzer is a semiconfocal cavity of length 200 mm. The flat, partially reflective mirror through which light enters the cavity is mounted on a mount that features piezo-electric actuators. At the other end is a curved mirror of focal length 200 mm. Behind this is a photodiode \footnote{the Thorlabs DET family of reversed biased photodiode products}.

The length of the optical cavity in the spectrum analyzer is thus modulated by sweeping the voltage that we put across the piezoelectric crystals. When the cavity length is such that the coupled light is close to a resonance of the cavity, we expect to see higher signal on the photodiode. 
The piezoelectric actuators are connected to a commercially available piezo control box that sweeps the voltage in a sawtooth wave type pattern, with a frequency $\sim$20Hz. 

The free spectral range of the spectrum analyzer describes exactly how far apart we expect the peaks to be. In the case of a hemiconfocal cavity like ours, the free spectral range is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \textnormal{FSR}=\frac{c}{8L}
\end{equation}

Therefore, we expect that as we scan the input mirror, we will see the same peaks coming into and out of resonance. The period over which this pattern repeats corresponds to scanning 187 MHz. Thus, if we have two peaks on the spectrum analyzer, we should be able to glean some information about how far apart they are.

A more complete discussion of the spectrum analyzer can be found in Appendix \ref{spectrumAnalyzer}.
